% \section*{Preparation for Oral Assessment I}

% Each student will be given one of three topics in viscoelasticity described below.  
% Your oral assessment will be a maximum of 20 minutes long in Prof. Estrada's office, GGB 2450. 
% You may prepare and bring a \textbf{single slide (pptx or pdf) per topic}, one of which you will use as a visual aid. 

% The goal of this assessment is to demonstrate and communicate your conceptual understanding of viscoelasticity, as well as your ability to reason aloud. 

% \begin{itemize}
% \item[\textbf{1. }]\textbf{Possible Topics} 
% \begin{outline} 
% \1 Comparative behavior of analog models under different loading scenarios 
% \1 Given some data, predicting material response to a given loading function 
% \1 Superposition and the requirements for linear viscoelasticity 
% \end{outline}
% \item[\textbf{2. }]\textbf{Your Slides} 
% \begin{outline} 
% \1 Your slide should be maximally helpful in guiding you in each topic, and may include diagrams, equations, and short bullet points (defined as being fewer than 2 lines of text per bullet). 
% \1 The minimum text size is 16-point font. 
% \1 Text must be in one of Arial, Times, Helvetica, Palatino, or Computer Modern (with others with approval of instructor).
% \end{outline}
% \item[\textbf{3. }]\textbf{Presentation} 
% \begin{outline}
% \1 You will open with a (timed) \textbf{3-minute-maximum} explanation, using your slide if desired to walk through any key concepts and their importance. 
% \1 After your explanation, you will enter a Q\&A/interactive discussion with Prof. Estrada focused on a specific scenario and further reasoning with hypothetical variations on the scenario. 
% \1 You should be able to define key terms, interpret the physical meaning of models, and contextualize material physics within soft material behavior. 
% \1 You are encouraged to “think aloud”—explaining your reasoning is what I'm looking for, even if you make corrections as you go. 
% \end{outline}
% \end{itemize}

\section*{Preparation for Oral Assessment II (Nov 24--25)}

Each student will be given one of two topics of their choice of the three areas described below. 
As in the first assessment, the second OA will be a maximum of 20 minutes long in Prof. Estrada's office, GGB 2450. 
You may prepare and bring a \textbf{single slide (pptx or pdf) per topic}, one of which you will use as a visual aid. 

The goal of this assessment is to demonstrate and communicate your conceptual understanding of viscoelasticity and hyperelasticity, as well as your ability to reason aloud. 

\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{1. }]\textbf{Possible Topics} 
\begin{outline} 
\1 Frequency-dependent material behavior and why we use viscoelastic spectra 
\1 3D viscoelasticity problems and the correspondence principle
\1 Hyperelastic constitutive laws and stress-strain relations 
\end{outline}
\item[\textbf{2. }]\textbf{Your Slides} 
\begin{outline} 
\1 Your slide should be maximally helpful in guiding you in each topic, and may include diagrams, equations, and short bullet points (defined as being fewer than 2 lines of text per bullet). 
\1 The minimum text size is 16-point font. 
\1 Text must be in one of Arial, Times, Helvetica, Palatino, or Computer Modern (with others with approval of instructor).
\end{outline}
\item[\textbf{3. }]\textbf{Presentation} 
\begin{outline}
\1 You will open with a (timed) \textbf{3-minute-maximum} response to a prompt, using your slide if desired to walk through any key concepts and their importance. 
\1 After this response, you will enter a Q\&A/interactive discussion with Prof. Estrada focused on a specific scenario and further reasoning with hypothetical variations on the scenario. 
\1 You should be able to define key terms, interpret the physical meaning of models, and contextualize material physics within soft material behavior. 
\1 You are encouraged to “think aloud”—explaining your reasoning is what I'm looking for, even if you make corrections as you go.
