\section*{Proposing a Research Topic in the Mechanics of Soft Materials}

As your major deliverable this semester, you are going to develop a ``white paper'' proposal for a research project in the area of soft material mechanics. 
This is deliberately a bit different from a standard report by focusing on being forward-looking. 
A white paper is a $3-5$ page document that contains:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A short \textbf{overview} of your topic
    \item A brief summary of the \textbf{current}, or state-of-the-art of \textbf{knowledge} in that area
    \item The \textbf{knowledge gap} you are interested in filling
    \item The \textbf{long-term goal} of what your project would do in the field if successful
    \item The testable \textbf{central hypothesis} governing the work
    \item Three \textbf{specific aims} you would pursue with their own working hypotheses
    \item \textbf{Preliminary data} backing up why you formulated and believe those hypotheses
    \item The \textbf{expected outcomes} or products of your proposed research that link back to the specific aims  
\end{enumerate}

This project development will occur over the course of the entire semester, and every assignment you have this semester will have a component that will develop this project proposal in some way. 
The schedule will be as follows:
